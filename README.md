# CatchApp
Vanderbilt Hackathon 2021

CatchApp is an android app that allows people to run and create ghosts which track their location as they run. These ghosts are then saved on their device and users are able to race against them in the future to improve their speed or endurance. When a person races against a ghost, if the ghost catches up to them then the runner receives an auditory cue.

This project won gold at the Vanderbilt Hackathon. The current build supports the creation of a single ghost which a person can then run against. I plan to enhance this project with an SQL backend and to add the following features:
1. The ability to create more ghosts
2. The ability to choose which ghost to run against
3. The ability to change the appearance of the ghost as well as the type of auditory cues
4. The ability to share ghosts with your friends
